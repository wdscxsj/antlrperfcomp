This repo contains files related to my reply in https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/1540. (Search for "It seems that the Go runtime is still 1~2x slower than Java.") All of them are kept untouched despite poor naming and other issues.

File listing:

- `C.g4` is identical to https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/c/C.g4.
- `cpu.prof` and `mem.prof` were generated by `cg.go`.
- `CJ.java` were used for comparison.
- `input.c` was generated from `lstrlib.c` shipped with [Lua v5.3.4](http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.4.tar.gz).
  
  1. Visual C++ was used to do macro expansion: `cl /EP lstrlib.c > input.c`.
  1. Duplicate newlines were removed (and some surplus `#pragma once`).
  1. `enum KOption` was commented out. (A bug in the Go runtime, maybe?)

Auxiliary files:

- `antlr.jar` v4.7.
- `java/*` were generated by `java -jar antlr.jar -o java C.g4`.

My environment:

- ANTLR 4.7 with Java 1.8 64-bit.
- Go 1.8 64-bit.
- Windows 7 64-bit.
